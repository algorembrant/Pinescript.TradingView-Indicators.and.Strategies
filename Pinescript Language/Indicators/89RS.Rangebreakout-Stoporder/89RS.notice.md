# Details
Locate the x-y coordinate of candles formed from 8pm to 9pm (20 oclock in asianmanila timeframe).

Among these candles, find the highest point and lowest point, and make vertical lines until it makes a rectangle from those vertices. This will serve as range.
   
    ┌──────────────  sessionHigh
    │
    │   ████  ← 8PM–9PM candles
    │
    └──────────────  sessionLow

Locate the y-coordinate and mark the high, low, and midpoit of the range.

    ┌────────────── HIGH   (green)
    │   ████
    │   ████
     ────────────── MID    (orange)
    │   ████
    │   ████
    └────────────── LOW    (red)

The high will serve as buystop and to calculate/locate it's TP y-coordinate, absolute value of high minus mid and times it by two, then add it to the high(buystop price) to project the y-coordinate of it's TP. 

Inverse the logic or mirror it for the sellstop.

The midpoint will serve as SL for both orders.
