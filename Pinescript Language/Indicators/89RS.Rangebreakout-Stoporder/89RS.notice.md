Locate the x-y coordinate of candles formed from 8pm to 9pm (20 oclock in asianmanila timeframe).
Among these candles, find the highest point and lowest point, and make vertical lines until it makes a rectangle from those vertices. This will serve as range.
   ┌──────────────  sessionHigh
   │
   │     ██████  ← 8PM–9PM candles

   └──────────────  sessionLow

Locate the y-coordinate and mark the high, low, and midpoit of the range.

    ┌────────────── HIGH   (green)
    │   ████
    │   ████
     ────────────── MID    (orange)
    │   ████
    │   ████
    └────────────── LOW    (red)

The high will serve as buystop and to calculate/locate it's TP y-coordinate, absolute value of high minus mid and times it by two, then add it to the high(buystop price) to project the y-coordinate of it's TP. 

Inverse the logic or mirror it for the sellstop.

The midpoint will serve as SL for both orders.

For Buy Stop:
# Entry (Buy Stop) = High
# Midpoint = (High + Low) / 2
# TP distance = abs(High - Mid) * 2
# TP (Take Profit) = High + (abs(High - Mid) * 2)

For Sell Stop (mirrored logic):

# Entry (Sell Stop) = Low
# Midpoint = (High + Low) / 2
# TP distance = abs(Mid - Low) * 2
# TP (Take Profit) = Low - (abs(Mid - Low) * 2)
