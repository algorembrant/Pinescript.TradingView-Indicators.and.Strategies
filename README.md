# Pinescript ≠ Javascript 
I will be using ".js" (JavaScript) in naming a file/s only for aesthetic-look of the code and has nothing to do with the function. 

Why? GitHub doesn't support Pinescript (a language for making trading indicators and automated strategies). However, the nearest language simillar to pinescript is javascript.
