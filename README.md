# Pinescript ≠ Javascript 
I will be using ".js" (JavaScript) in naming a file/s only for aesthetic-look of the code and has nothing to do with the function. 

**Why?** GitHub doesn't support Pinescript (a language for making trading indicators and automated strategies). However, the nearest language simillar to pinescript is javascript. That way the system will count it as element language for statistics (% about how often a language is used inside the repository). 

Altho it doesn't suport pinescript function, there's a package for the colored syntax in VS. The output (visualization indicators and strategies) doesn't show up unless we paste the pinescript code on it's intended IDE, which is the PineEditor in the TradingView platform.
